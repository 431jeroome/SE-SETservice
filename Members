# Brief description about SETservice
      Student Expense Tracker is a simple and easy-to-use app designed to help students manage their daily expenses. 
      It allows users to record income and spending, categorize expenses (like food, transport, or study materials), 
      and view summaries or charts to track where their money goes. The goal is to help students stay organized, 
      save money, and build better financial habits.
