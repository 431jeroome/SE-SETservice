What challenges did you encounter while collaborating through Git and GitHub, and how did your group address them?

As a student, one of the main challenges we faced while collaborating through Git and GitHub was dealing with merge
conflicts when a member edited the same files. It was also confusing at first to understand the difference 
between committing locally and pushing to the remote repository. To solve this, our group decided to communicate 
regularly before making big changes and to assign specific parts of the project to each member. Over time, we got 
more comfortable with Git commands and learned the importance of teamwork and version control discipline.
